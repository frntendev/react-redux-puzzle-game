### Installation

```
npm install
```

### Run the project

npm start

### Game Rules

 - The first click on the board will define the playerâ€™s start position; the starting point from where the game will need to build a new level of clickable fields.
 - After the first click, the player can only click on available fields by following the rules of movement. The player can click on any box in the specific range from the previously clicked box.
 - Whenever the player fails to complete a level, they lose a number of lives equal to the number of unclicked boxes in that level.
 - The player can move not more or less than three fields vertically and horizontally, or he can move not more or less than two fields diagonally.
